Main features of the ideal system
#################################

In its ideal form the ncovid system allow users to perform the whole ml pipeline to create optimal forecast system for the intended pandemic. This requires:

- Data aggregation
   - Automatic update of the databases;
   - Allow the user to Upload data
- Visualization
   - Show important curves for the selected regions
   - Show many levels of granularity (country, state, cities, etc)
- Train and evaluate forecast models
   - Allow many techniques
   - multiple evaluation metrics
   - Automatic evaluation
- Show forecasts
   - From pre-trained models
   - Show metrics that indicates the models accuracy (degree of confidence)
- Data processing from the pandemic
   - Correlation indices
   - data cleaning
- Configure the parameters of the forecast model
   - type, hyperparameters, inputs, window of forecast, etc..
- Simulate the effects that actions have over the features (doing X, Y, Z can reduce the death tool by alpha)

These are some of the requirements of the system in its full form.
